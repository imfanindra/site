In the first semester of my M.Des, we had the course - **Crafts, Cultures, and Habitat Studies**, and as a part of this, we got to explore Jaipur’s rich crafts and culture. We spent time with the artisans practicing **Thathera craft**, a traditional metalworking art. Talking to them, we heard their stories—about their craft, their struggles, and their daily lives. Inspired by our experience, **we created a book** capturing everything we learned and discovered.
