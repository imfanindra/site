### Overview <span class="text-black/50">of this personal project</span>
This case study focuses on addressing the challenges faced by **employees working in big cities**, such as **unorganized parking systems and time-consuming searches**. The solution entails a mobile app designed to optimize employees’ parking experiences by **improving parking efficiency, enhancing user convenience, and providing real-time parking information.** 

### <span class="text-black/50">Understanding the</span> problem
Based on my primary research, I've made two **user personas.**

#### Defining <span class="text-black/50"> the problems</span>
Based on the my primary research, I found three primary issues to be addressed.

- Employees **struggle to find empty parking spots** during busy hours. This causes delays, frustration, and reduced productivity.

- **Unauthorized parking**, whether by employees or visitors, worsens the shortage of designated parking spaces for employees.

- Additionally, the frequent use of **car alarms** in parking lots creates **excessive noise** in the vicinity of the office area.

### <span class="text-black/50"> Scope for </span>possible improvements

<strong>Registering with car details</strong> - The users can be asked to register their car details at sign-up. This allows us to recommend more suitable parking spots according to their vehicles.

<strong>‍Paid parking system</strong> - Currently, the app is limited to managing parking in office buildings. However, we could develop the app further to make it accessible to the general public. This would allow building owners to list their available parking spaces and allow drivers to park their vehicles. By doing so, both parties can benefit from this arrangement.
