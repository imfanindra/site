### Conclusion

This project aimed to enhance the YouTube Music Android app's user experience while staying true to its core identity. Inspired by competitors like Spotify and Apple Music, a light theme refreshed the home screen. It is important to note that this redesign is focused solely on the homepage, player page, and lyrics tab to improve accessibility and engagement. It preserved the app's essence while making necessary changes for a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience.
